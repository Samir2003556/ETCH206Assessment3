    <h1>Fostering Social Development</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever seen how quickly toddlers copy each other’s smiles and actions? Social development starts with simple interactions, like a baby cooing back to a caregiver or two toddlers giggling over the same toy. These moments build trust, relationships, and a sense of belonging (Garvis et al., 2019).
    </p>

    <h2>Supporting Social Development as an Educator</h2>
    <p>
      Educators nurture this growth through warm, responsive care. “Serve and return” exchanges – smiling or echoing a baby’s sound – help build both social and brain pathways (Harding, 2023). For toddlers, modelling sharing and guiding turn-taking during play is essential. What would you do if two children wanted the same puzzle piece? This is where gentle guidance helps toddlers practise cooperation and empathy (Kaywork, 2020).

      Social learning happens through play with caregivers and peers. Sing call‑and‑response songs (music);
      engage in hand‑clapping rhymes (movement); use puppet shows to model friendship scenarios (drama);
      read books featuring cooperation and diversity (language); and provide group art projects such as
      collaborative murals (art).
