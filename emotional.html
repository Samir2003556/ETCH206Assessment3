    <h1>Fostering Emotional Development</h1>
    <p>
      There is also the emotional development during infancy and toddler years that constitute the premise of lifetime mental health, as well as resiliency and social competence. The basic emotions of joy, sadness, and fear become the foundation of infant emotional expression and later develop into the ability to identify and have control over these emotions with the help of adults (Izard & Trentacosta, 2020). In consistency and responsive care, the feeling of trust and emotional security grows and makes a child feel safe to explore and learn (Kaywork, 2020). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The teachers have a significant role to play since they should be sensitive to the signals given by the children, demonstrate positive emotional behaviours and establish a relaxed atmosphere. Be You (2024) urges that social-emotional wellbeing can be fostered through facilitating the children to name their feelings, fostering co-regulation, creating routines.

    <!-- <h2>Authentic Curriculum Provision</h2>
    <p>
      Integrate emotional development into all curriculum areas. Use art to paint feelings with colours
      and shapes; combine music and movement in “feelings dances”; read stories that highlight
      characters’ emotions; engage in dramatisation and puppetry to rehearse coping strategies; and
      explore science by examining how our hearts beat faster when excited.
