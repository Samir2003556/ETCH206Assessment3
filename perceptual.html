    <h1>Perceptual Development &amp; The Five Senses</h1>
    <p>
      Perceptual development is the process by which infants and toddlers begin to perceive and interpret the sensations they encounter in their surrounding world. These are the big five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell, and all of them combine to guide children and make their environment comprehensible to them (Sheridan et al., 2022). Since a baby is born with these senses, they learn, find the comfort they need, and associate with individuals and things. Sensory-rich activities can be facilitated by educators who play a critical role in promoting the development of children’s brains, cognitive functions, and emotional safety (Berk & Meyers, 2023; Essa & Burnham, 2019).

          <td>Plan and implement activities that engage all five senses—looking, listening, touching,
            tasting and smelling—so children can explore cause and effect with varied materials
            (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2023).</td>

          <td>Respect Individual Sensitivities</td>
          <td>Observe each child’s sensory preferences and accommodate sensitivities: for example,
            some infants dislike loud noises or dark colours while others seek additional input
            (Sheridan et&nbsp;al., 2022).</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Rich Descriptive Language</td>
          <td>Use vivid words to label sensations and support vocabulary: describe items as “squishy” or
            “bumpy,” and invite children to notice differences by saying “Listen to the quiet
            shaker” (Feeney et&nbsp;al., 2019).</td>

    <h2>Authentic Curriculum Provision</h2>
    <p>
      The senses connect seamlessly to many curriculum areas.  In <strong>science</strong>, children investigate
      cause and effect by exploring water, testing warm and cold toys and noticing materials that
      change in texture (DEEWR, 2009).  In <strong>art</strong>, experiences such as finger painting, texture
      collages and sponge stamping allow toddlers to create with their hands while feeling
      different surfaces.  <strong>Music</strong> invites exploration of soft and loud sounds, rhythm and tone
      using shakers, bells and drums.  These experiences integrate with language and literacy when
      educators provide descriptive vocabulary for sensations and encourage children to talk about
      what they see, hear, smell, taste and touch.

    <h2>Books, Songs, Rhymes &amp; Movement Game</h2>
    <p>Support perceptual development with sensory‑focused resources. Record videos of group members presenting these.</p>
    <h3>Children’s Books</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Heads and Tails</em> by John Canty – engages children’s visual perception, memory and
        reasoning by asking them to guess animals from partial illustrations (Canty, 2017).</li>
      <li><em>Ten Little Figs</em> by Rhian Williams &amp; Nathaniel Eckstrom – integrates counting with
        sensory‑rich Australian wildlife and plants to enhance visual–spatial awareness, pattern
        identification and aural rhythm (Williams &amp; Eckstrom, 2020).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Songs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“The Five Senses Song” – teaches each of the senses through repetition and action words.</li>
      <li>“This Is the Way We Play” – a creative, customisable song with actions (e.g., “this is the
        way we squish and squeeze”) that can incorporate children’s sensory ideas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rhymes/Lullabies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Tickle Tickle Little Star” – uses touch and rhythm as a bonding game and sensory
        experience.</li>
      <li>“Open Shut Them” – builds fine motor skills and visual tracking as children open and close
        their hands.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Movement Game</h3>
    <p><strong>Mystery Box Game</strong> – invite children to put their hands into a covered box and feel
      hidden objects.  Without seeing the item, they describe its texture, shape and size using
      words like “soft,” “bumpy” and “round.”  This playful game improves tactile discrimination,
      vocabulary and sensory awareness.</p>
