    <h1>Supporting Cognitive Development</h1>
    <p>
      Cognitive development of infants and toddlers forms a basis to the processes of problem solving, learning, and thinking. This is the stage of rapid brain development when children learn key competencies including the ability to reason, remember and be attentive (Berk & Meyers, 2023). The sensorimotor stage is a phase expressed by Piaget theory, where the infants discover things by using sense and movement in the environment (McDevitt & Ormrod, 2020). The sociocultural theory underlines the aspect of social interaction as the cause of enhancing cognitive abilities as put forward by Vygotsky (1978).

    <h2>Teaching Competencies &amp; Skills</h2>
    <p>
      The educator practices intentional, responsive and developmentally appropriate teaching activities that enhance cognitive development of the infants and toddlers (Fellowes & Oakley, 2019). Educators facilitate the thought process by scaffolding children to learn, providing them with the help that is immediately beyond his capacity to learn, within the Zone of Proximal Development proposed by Vygotsky (Vygotsky, 1978). Memory, attention, and cause-effect reasoning are some of the cognitive abilities promoted through rich sensory experiences, manipulative materials and time to practice trial and error play (Berk & Meyers, 2023). Altogether, educator serve to facilitate cognitive growth through the stimulation of interesting conditions, purposeful language, and responsive relationships that continue to stimulate exploration, focus, and developing thought processes.
    </p>

    <!-- <h2>Authentic Curriculum Provision</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive growth flourishes when learning opportunities are embedded within everyday routines
      and play. Integrate multiple curriculum areas: mathematics through problem‑solving, reasoning,
      classification and patterning; science through inquiry, observation and simple experimentation;
      English through storytelling, oral language and emergent literacy; and Humanities and Social
      Sciences through children’s questions about their world. Use treasure baskets filled with
      household objects to explore textures (science); offer stacking blocks, shape sorters and
      construction toys (mathematics &amp; engineering); read engaging picture books and sing counting
      songs (language &amp; music); and provide opportunities for cause‑and‑effect exploration with
      water, sand and movement games.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning &amp; Wellbeing Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive learning is intertwined with wellbeing. Shared routines and rituals support
      executive functioning, including memory and attention. Helping children regulate their emotions
      enhances focused thinking and problem solving. Engaging with books, patterns and technology
      fosters abstract reasoning and literacy‑based cognition.

  <h3>Learning &amp; Wellbeing Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Supports executive functioning through shared routines (e.g., memory, attention)</li>

<section class="resources">
  <h3>Children’s Books</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Five Big Trucks:</strong> This book helps in building memory, recognition, and problem solving (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2023). Children acquire numeracy skills by counting and sequencing concepts.</li>
    <li><strong>The Little Rabbit Who Lost Her Hop:</strong> Children also learn a course of events, which sharpens the memory and recall skills (Isbell et al., 2004). Symbolic thinking, which plays a significant role in early cognitive development, is also developed (Berk, 2013).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Children’s Songs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Wheels on the Bus:</strong> Facilitates the mental growth of children, fostering the development of memory, sequencing abilities, and language using repetitive and predictable patterns (Perry, 2002).</li>
    <li><strong>Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes:</strong> Supports cognitive development by encouraging children to follow multi-step instructions and improves their memory, listening skills, and executive function as they remember and perform the movement sequence.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Children’s Rhymes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Make a Pizza:</strong> Facilitates cognitive development in infants and toddlers through forming memories and symbolic thinking. Participating in the rhyme, children begin associating the actions with going through the easy steps with the text of the rhyme, which allows them to learn about sequencing and cause-and-effect (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2023).</li>
    <li><strong>Five Little Ducks:</strong> Children are able to anticipate and remember a set of events through the repetition of a nursery rhyme; therefore, memory and recall are aided through this process.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Children’s Game</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simon Says:</strong> Helps children build key self-management and problem-solving skills that are necessary in the learning process and socialization (Berk &amp; Meyers, 2023).</li>
  </ul>
