    <h1>Supporting Cognitive Development</h1>
    <p>
      Cognitive development of infants and toddlers forms a basis to the processes of problem solving, learning, and thinking. This is the stage of rapid brain development when children learn key competencies including the ability to reason, remember and be attentive (Berk & Meyers, 2023). The sensorimotor stage is a phase expressed by Piaget theory, where the infants discover things by using sense and movement in the environment (McDevitt & Ormrod, 2020). The sociocultural theory underlines the aspect of social interaction as the cause of enhancing cognitive abilities as put forward by Vygotsky (1978).

    <h2>Authentic Curriculum Provision</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive growth flourishes when learning opportunities are embedded within everyday routines
      and play. Integrate multiple curriculum areas: mathematics through problem‑solving, reasoning,
      classification and patterning; science through inquiry, observation and simple experimentation;
      English through storytelling, oral language and emergent literacy; and Humanities and Social
      Sciences through children’s questions about their world. Use treasure baskets filled with
      household objects to explore textures (science); offer stacking blocks, shape sorters and
      construction toys (mathematics &amp; engineering); read engaging picture books and sing counting
      songs (language &amp; music); and provide opportunities for cause‑and‑effect exploration with
      water, sand and movement games.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning &amp; Wellbeing Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive learning is intertwined with wellbeing. Shared routines and rituals support
      executive functioning, including memory and attention. Helping children regulate their emotions
      enhances focused thinking and problem solving. Engaging with books, patterns and technology
      fosters abstract reasoning and literacy‑based cognition.

    <h2>Books, Songs, Rhymes &amp; Movement Game</h2>
    <p>Choose from the following resources to support cognitive growth. Record a video of each book reading, song, rhyme and game featuring different group members.</p>
    <h3>Children’s Books</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Five Big Trucks</em> – builds memory, recognition and problem‑solving skills; counting and sequencing concepts support early numeracy.</li>
      <li><em>The Little Rabbit Who Lost Her Hop</em> – follows a sequence of events that sharpens memory and recall; encourages symbolic thinking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Songs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“The Wheels on the Bus” – fosters memory, sequencing and language development through repetitive, predictable patterns.</li>
      <li>“Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes” – encourages following multi‑step instructions and improves memory, listening skills and executive function.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rhymes/Lullabies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“Make a Pizza” – supports cognitive skills through sequencing and cause‑and‑effect; children associate actions with steps in the rhyme.</li>
      <li>“Five Little Ducks” – repetition and counting help children anticipate events, strengthening memory and recall.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Movement Game</h3>
    <p><strong>Simon Says</strong> – encourages self‑management and problem‑solving skills. Children listen carefully and follow directions only when preceded by “Simon says,” practising attention and impulse control.</p>
