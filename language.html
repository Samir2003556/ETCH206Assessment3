    <h1>Facilitating Language &amp; Literacy Development</h1>
    <p>
      Language and literacy development describes the early skills upon which infants and toddlers can reach the level of communication, understanding, and reading and writing texts. It comprises words and phrases, non-verbal and verbal interaction, vocabulary building, phonological awareness, and emergent literacy (Neuman & Dickinson, 2021).
      The use of cry, coo and babble as the basis of language development in infants and toddlers is followed in their language development by the use of first words, two-word combinations or sentence-like structures. The process of literacy development is achieved through exposure to books, print awareness and realisation that symbols have a meaning (Roskos et al., 2023).

    <h2>Teaching Competencies</h2>
    <p>
      Engaging in back-and-forth interactions, following children's interests and cues.
      Using varied vocabulary, descriptive language, and complex sentence structures.
      Establishing print-rich environments with accessible books and writing materials.
      Incorporating rhymes, songs, and sound play into daily routines.
      Providing appropriate levels of support to extend children's communication attempts.
      Honouring home languages and incorporating diverse literary traditions.
    </p>

    <!-- <h2>Authentic Curriculum Provision</h2>
    <p>
      Language opportunities weave through all curriculum areas. Use songs and chants during
      transitions (movement); incorporate puppets to tell science and math stories (drama); encourage
      toddlers to dictate stories about their art (art &amp; literacy); explore informational books about
      nature and technology (science &amp; engineering); and integrate rhythm and rhyme into mathematics
      games (numeracy).
